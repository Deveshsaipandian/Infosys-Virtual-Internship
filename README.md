Problem Statement

Healthcare planning and administrative decision-making often suffer from unstructured datasets. The absence of a unified analytical view makes it difficult to assess hospital capacity, workforce availability, and emergency preparedness efficiently. This limitation restricts data-driven healthcare management and resource optimization

Proposed Solution

The Healthcare Operations Analytics Dashboard was designed to transform structured healthcare data into meaningful insights. Built using Python and Streamlit, the system integrates infrastructure metrics, workforce indicators, and readiness assessments into an interactive visualization platform. The dashboard enables stakeholders to perform comparative analysis, monitor healthcare indicators, and explore region-specific healthcare patterns.
